    one calander year. The names of the Slams in the order they occur are: Australian Open, Roland-Garros (or French Open), Wimbledon, and
    the US Open.
  </p>

<h2>History of Tennis</h2>
  <p> Tennis is a sport that is played by both men and women, who use a raquet strung with some cord, and  hit a ball back and forth at
    one another until someone either: a) cannot hit the ball back across the net b) hits the ball out of bounds or into the net. The sport was
    first played on grass in England sometime in the mid 19th century as a pastime. Since then, the sport has evolved worldwide into a
    tremendously very efficient workout (you can burn lots of calories!), popular, and competitive sport. Both singles and doubles tennis
    have been included in the Summer Olympic Games since 1896, and the Paralympic Games since 1992. Keep reading to learn more about the sport.


  </p>


<h2>How It's Played</h2>
  <p>
    The rules of the game are simple. For men, its the first person to win 3 out of 5 sets, and for women, it is best 2 out of 3 sets.
    A set consists of 6 different games, and whomever wins 6 games first, wins the set. But, you <strong>MUST</strong> win a set by at least
    <i>two</i> games. For example, you can win a set with a game score of 6-4, but it <strong>cannot</strong> be 6-5. If someone does not win
    to make the score 7-5 and end the set, the score would then be 6-6, and a tiebreaker would ensue. The tiebreaker is won by the first person
    to reach 7 points, again winning by at least 2.<br>

   </br>
   Lastly, there is the game. A game is kind of complicated...but you basically have to win four points to win. Here is a list of the names
    of different types of points in a game:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First Point: 0 AKA "love"</li>
      <li>Second Point: 15</li>
      <li>Third Point: 30</li>
      <li> Fourth Point: 40 </li>
      <li> Deuce: when the score is ties at 40-40</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Like a set or tiebreaker, you must also win a game by two points, so if there is a deuce (40-40), then whoever wins the next point will
    have the advantage AKA "adv". If the person with the adv wins the next point, they will win the game. If the person with the adv loses
    the next point, their score will be reverted back to 40, and they lose the advantage.
  </p>

  <h2>The Court</h2>
    <p>
      All courts are the same size, but not all the same texture. A court can range from a: hard court (cememt), grass, or clay. The four
      grand slams are played on 3 different materials, making it a challenge for the competitors.<br>


    </br>
    Tennis can either be played with 2 players (singles) or a group of 4 player, with two on each team (doubles). Depending on whether
      or not you are playing singles or doubles, determines which lines on the court you will use to signify out of bounds. When playing
      doubles, the entire court is used, and with singles the width of the court is smaller.

  <h2>Serves</h2>
    <p>
      Each player rotates on who after eacch game. After every odd game, the players will switch sides of the court, so no one has an unfair
      advantage. To serve the player stands behind the baseline and, to start, on the right side of the hash mark and the center of the baseline.
      After each serve in a game, the server switches sides of the hash mark (to the left and right of the court). <br>

    </br>The purpose of the serve is to start the point, but in order for the serve to count, it must land in the opposite (of the side of the court
      that the serve is taking place) square, called the service box, on the other side of the net. The opponet can then let the ball bounce only
      <i>once</i> before returning the serve and continuing on with the game. For doubles, the service box is extended to the width of the court.
      Each server is allowed two chances to get the ball over the net and in the square on their serve. If on their first serve, the serve hits
      the top of net but falls into the service box, it is called a 'let', and the server gets to try again. If there is a let on the second serve,
       the point continues as normal with no reserve.<br>

    </br>If the server fails to get the ball into play within the two alloted serves, a double fault is called and a point is awarded to the
      opponent. On the other hand, if the server manages on their first serve to get the ball in play and the opponent cannot return, an ace
      is called and the server is awarded a point.
